# ⚡ Learning C# with Ease

After mastering **Java**, I explored **C#**, which felt familiar due to its similarity with both **Java** and **C++**.  
This repository contains the programs and exercises I worked on while learning C# concepts quickly and effectively.

## 📘 Topics Covered
- Syntax and Data Types  
- Conditional Statements and Loops  
- Classes, Objects, and Inheritance  
- Interfaces and Abstract Classes  
- Collections and Generics  
- Exception Handling  
- Basic File I/O and Namespaces

## 💡 Learning Journey
My experience with **C++** (for logic and memory handling) and **Java** (for OOP and structure) made learning **C#** smooth and fun.

## ⚙️ How to Run
You can compile and run programs using:
```bash
csc filename.cs
./filename.exe
